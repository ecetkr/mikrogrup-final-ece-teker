# Restaurant Revenue Prediction: Mikrogrup Final ðŸ’¬

Welcome to the Restaurant Revenue Prediction Application! In the competitive world of the restaurant industry, making informed decisions is crucial for success. Our application leverages the power of machine learning to predict monthly revenue for restaurants, helping owners and managers strategize more effectively.

## Overview
This is a sample Flask application developed in Python for web as part of the Mi-Power Women Empowerment Program by Group 7 (All the improvements made after the group project are by Ece Teker). The primary purpose of this application is to provide restaurant owners with a tool to forecast their monthly revenue based on various input factors. By inputting key details about their restaurant's operations, such as the number of customers, menu prices, marketing spend, cuisine type, average customer spending, promotions, and reviews, users can receive a data-driven prediction of their expected revenue.

## Features
- User-Friendly Interface: Our application features a clean, intuitive interface where users can easily input relevant data about their restaurant.
- Machine Learning Models: The application utilizes advanced machine learning models, including Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and XGBoost, to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.
- Data Insights: Gain insights into how different factors impact your restaurant's revenue, helping you make strategic decisions to optimize profitability.
- Real-Time Predictions: Get instant predictions by submitting your data through the application's web interface.
